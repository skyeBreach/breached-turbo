## How to Contribute

Unfortunately we are currently not accepting third-party/external contributions, due to how early BreachedTurbo is in
its development cycle. Once we have moved passed the initial stage of development we will look at opening up
BreachedTurbo for contributions from the wider OpenSource community.

Even though you may not be able to currently directly contribute, we do read all issues, discussions, etc and are
usually happy to take feedback into account. If you have a bug report, a feature request, or just want to give us
general feedback please head over to the discussion boards or create a new issue.

If you wish to keep up with the development of BreachedTurbo, and see when we open the project up to contributions,
please consider watching the repository and giving us a star as it would help massively.

We appreciate your patience with this project, and can't wait to hear your ideas and receive your contributions in the
future ðŸ’œ!
